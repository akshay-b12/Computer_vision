Computer Vision - Coursework

Assignment-0 : Introduction to CV tasks and	understanding OpenCV library.
-----Tasks------
1. Chroma Keying with OpenCV
2. Face detection
3. Divide video into shots using image difference
(Refer Report)

Assignment-1 : Camera Caliberation
-----Tasks------
1. Direct Linear Transform (DLT) based camera caliberation implementation from scratch. Extended it to RANSAC based variant.
2. Camera calibration using Zhang's method (using method implemented in OpenCV)

Assignment-2 : Image Mosaicing and Stereo Correspondence
-----Tasks------
1. Image Mosaicing : Image stitching using SIFT and SURF feature detector and descriptor and homography transformation.
2. Stereo Correspondences :
	(i) Intensity Window-based correlation for rectifying images and stereo correspondence.
	(ii) Greedy matching based stereo correspondence.
	(iii) Dynamic programming solution for Stereo Correspondence on the rectified images.
	
Assignment-3 : Grab-cut

-----Task------
1. Lucas-Kanade optical flow implementation.
2. Segmentation using optical flow.
3. Moving object tracking using segmented image.
